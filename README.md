Ladies, gentlemen, and Saiyans of all power levels, gather 'round and prepare to be in awe! For today we have brought to you technology straight from Capsule Corp. headquarters.
My name is Dr. PJs, one of the scientist aides of the late great Dr. Briefs.
We’ve been working around the clock to bring you this modern and slick website that was designed not only to read your power levels, but to also compare yourself to the over 9000* users that we have stored on this small site.
By entering your name and clicking this button you can find out if you can beat a turtle! And maybe even Krillin! (Everyone can beat Krillin).

And we guarantee all your data is private and won’t be shared and sold to third-party data brokers for profit**.
This website is bound to put an end to your personal rivalry, and to show which one of you is indeed the strongest.
Do you think you could step up and be as powerful as Goku?
Well put down those senzu beans and enter your name and find out...
